					==================== Project Logger Application - Refactor Summary ====================

			SCOPE
					- Naming conventions according to Google's JavaScript Style Guide 
					  (https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#naming)
					- Best Practices for project structure and coding style, according to 
					  (https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)
					- Incorpoarating Helmet
					- Review of changes
				
				
			IMPLEMENTATION	
					NAMING:
						- Adhering to naming conventions, I made changes to function and variable names 
						  as well as variable initializations.
						- After changing the name of the file I had imported, I had to make sure that all 
						  occurences of the variable was changed accordingly.
						- I made changes to variable initializations where I made use of 'var' I changed 
						  it to 'let' or 'const'. 

					BEST PRACTICES:
						- Firstly, I formatted the document with Prittier, then 
						- reviewed the structure and made adjustments to spacing for better legibility 
						  since my code has documentation/comments inbetween the actual code.
						- I then made sure that all imports were at the top of the code and that the 
						  grouping of code alike was done.
						- I got rid of code i used during debugging and testing-Mainly console.log statements. 
						- I cleaned up the code and deleted unused code and declarations
						- I ensured that my app.js and server.js files were separate and that my server's
						  package.json file had all the dependencies and correct versions of dependencies
						  listed.
					
					HELMET INTEGRATION:
						- Firstly, I installed Helmet from the integrated terminal and then imported the 
						  module to my server.js file using 'NodeRequire'.
						- I then configured the DNS prefetch Control and the frameguard properties to help 
						  control DNS prefetching and improve user privacy as well as preventing clickjacking 
						  attacks (hidden/invisible <iframe> containing malicious code).
				
					REVIEW:
						- After the rafactoring was complete I went through the code, making sure that the 
						  all the changes were complete and that there was nothing outstanding.
						- I made sure that all the code and variables declared are neccessary/required.
						- I check for consistency of coding style.
